# BluSTL Traffic Fork 
BluSTL (pronounced "blue steel") is a MATLAB toolkit for automatically generating hybrid controllers from specifications written in Signal Temporal Logic.

This fork of the [original BluSTL repository](https://github.com/BluSTL/BluSTL) adds a freeway traffic example with dynamics based off of the [asymmetric cell transmission model](http://www.me.berkeley.edu/~horowitz/Publications_files/Papers_numbered/Journal/80J_Gomes_TRC06.pdf). The system dynamics are piecewise affine but we adopt a different form that more succinctly encodes traffic flow.

# Project Status
The example is currently incomplete.
